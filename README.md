# OpenMP and OpenMPI Exploration Project
This project aims to explore the fundamental features of OpenMP and OpenMPI to enhance the understanding and proficiency of parallel programming in C++. The focus will be on developing programs that leverage the capabilities of these parallelization frameworks.

## Project Goals
1. Gain insights into the basics of OpenMP parallel programming.
Explore directives, clauses, and constructs for parallelizing code segments.
Implement simple programs to demonstrate parallelism using OpenMP.
Exploring OpenMPI:

2. Delve into the fundamentals of OpenMPI for distributed memory parallelism.
Learn about message passing and communication between processes.
Develop programs that utilize OpenMPI to solve parallel computing problems.
Integration with C++:

3. Apply the acquired knowledge to C++ programming.
Create hybrid programs that combine both OpenMP and OpenMPI for optimized parallel execution.
