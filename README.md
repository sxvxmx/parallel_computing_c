# OpenMP and OpenMPI Exploration Project
This project aims to explore the fundamental features of OpenMP and OpenMPI to enhance the understanding and proficiency of parallel programming in C++. The focus will be on developing programs that leverage the capabilities of these parallelization frameworks.

## Project Goals
Understanding OpenMP:

1. Gain insights into the basics of OpenMP parallel programming.
Explore directives, clauses, and constructs for parallelizing code segments.
Implement simple programs to demonstrate parallelism using OpenMP.
Exploring OpenMPI:

2. Delve into the fundamentals of OpenMPI for distributed memory parallelism.
Learn about message passing and communication between processes.
Develop programs that utilize OpenMPI to solve parallel computing problems.
Integration with C++:

3. Apply the acquired knowledge to C++ programming.
Create hybrid programs that combine both OpenMP and OpenMPI for optimized parallel execution.
